 What is cryptology cryptanalysis and cryptography
```
- Cryptology is the study of codes, both creating and solving them.
- Cryptography is the art of creating codes.
- Cryptanalysis is the art of surreptitiously revealing the contents of coded messages, 
  breaking codes, that were not intended for you as a recipient.

* Threat
```
A potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action,
or event that could breach security and cause harm. That is, a threat is a possible danger that might
exploit a vulnerability.
```

* Attack
```
An assault on system security that derives from an intelligent threat; that is, an intelligent act that
is a deliberate attempt (especially in the sense of a method or technique) to evade security services
and violate the security policy of a system.
```

Active and Passive attacks difference :

* Active
```
 In Active attack, an attacker tries to modify the content of the messages.
 ```
* Passive
```
in Passive attack, an attacker observes the messages, copy them and may use them for malicious purposes.

What are the main types of cyber security threats?
```
- Distributed denial of service (DDoS)
- Man in the Middle (MitM)
- Social engineering.
- Malware and spyware.
- Password attacks.
- Advanced persistent threats (APT)
```
Explain security attacks performed on information or data
```
A security attack is an unauthorized attempt to steal, damage,

#### Assignment 1;
what is prolog ?
```
Prolog is a logic programming language. It has important role in artificial intelligence. 
Unlike many other programming languages, Prolog is intended primarily as a declarative programming language. 
In prolog, logic is expressed as relations (called as Facts and Rules). Core heart of prolog lies at the logic being applied. 
Formulation or Computation is carried out by running a query over these relations.

 What is cryptology cryptanalysis and cryptography
```
- Cryptology is the study of codes, both creating and solving them.
- Cryptography is the art of creating codes.
- Cryptanalysis is the art of surreptitiously revealing the contents of coded messages, 
  breaking codes, that were not intended for you as a recipient.

* Threat
```
A potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action,
or event that could breach security and cause harm. That is, a threat is a possible danger that might
exploit a vulnerability.
```

* Attack
```
An assault on system security that derives from an intelligent threat; that is, an intelligent act that
is a deliberate attempt (especially in the sense of a method or technique) to evade security services
and violate the security policy of a system.
```

Active and Passive attacks difference :

* Active
```
 In Active attack, an attacker tries to modify the content of the messages.
 ```
* Passive
```
in Passive attack, an attacker observes the messages, copy them and may use them for malicious purposes.

What are the main types of cyber security threats?
```
- Distributed denial of service (DDoS)
- Man in the Middle (MitM)
- Social engineering.
- Malware and spyware.
- Password attacks.
- Advanced persistent threats (APT)
```
Explain security attacks performed on information or data
```
A security attack is an unauthorized attempt to steal, damage, 
or expose data from an information system such as your website.

#### Assignment 1;

1.what is prolog ?
```
- Prolog is a logic programming language. It has important role in artificial intelligence. 
- Unlike many other programming languages, Prolog is intended primarily as a declarative programming language. 
- In prolog, logic is expressed as relations (called as Facts and Rules). Core heart of prolog lies at the logic being applied. 
- Formulation or Computation is carried out by running a query over these relations.
```

</p>

4.features of prolog
```
The main characteristics/notions of the Visual Prolog programming language are:
based on logical programming with Horn clauses.

- fully object oriented.
- object predicate values (delegates)
- strongly typed.
- algebraic data types.
- pattern matching and unification.
- controlled non-determinism.
- fully integrated fact databases.
```

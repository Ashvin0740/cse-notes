```
A potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action,
or event that could breach security and cause harm. That is, a threat is a possible danger that might
exploit a vulnerability.

```
An assault on system security that derives from an intelligent threat; that is, an intelligent act that
is a deliberate attempt (especially in the sense of a method or technique) to evade security services
and violate the security policy of a system.
